# Get-GIACGrads  

A little script I created to accomplish two things.  First, I wanted to learn how to pull information from a website.  Second, I had to watch the GIAC most current certified page to see if a co-worker passed his test.  Drop this is a folder then have PowerShell execute it in a continuous loop and just watch to see if your co-worker passes the test.
