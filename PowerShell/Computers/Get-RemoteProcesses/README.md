# Get-RemoteProcesses

This is a rough draft of the tool.  It is enought to get you started and accomplish the task.  Key things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure PowerShell Remoting is enabled on the remote machines.  I left a note for which command to run in the notes.
2. Make sure that the .csv you use has the "ComputerName" column or change the code to reflect your column heading name of your machine names.
