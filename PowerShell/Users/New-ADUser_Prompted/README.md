# New-ADUser_Prompted  

New-ADUser_Prompted is a script I used everyday as a Systems Administrator.  It was one of the first big scripts I built back in PowerShell .v2.  It will prompt you for all the important information (important for my former organization) and string together everything else.  It leaves the user disabled until the user arrives and they get properly in-processed.
