# Ping-Hosts

A dirty little script to read in a text file with a list of IPs or Hostnames and then pings them.

Script assumes the hostfile contains a list of IP addressess.  It reads in the file then pings (test-connection) each one.  The list can contain host names or IP address, as long as they are in a single column.
